Test Script for Testing

Test 1: Check with no input: should and does prompt user to try again with
     two input files
Test 2: Check with one incorrect file input: should and does prompt user to
     try again with two input files
Test 3: Check options 1-12, only with valid inputs (I saved results of this
     in results-of-test.txt): Everything should work as expected, which it
     does. Options 1 and 2 print what they should to the terminal, while
     options 3-11 print their appropriate data to the results text file,
     and option 12 quits the program and tells the user where their results are.
Test 4: Try to run program with two incorrect files: should and does prompt
     user by telling them which files should be used.
Test 5: Try to run program with second file incorrect: should and does
     prompt user by telling them which file should be used.
Test 5: Check with both correct files then quit.
Test 6: (copy-pasted below, because I forgot to test this originally) Test
     invalid input as options. I will check numbers below 1 and above
     12 for the main switch, and numbers below 1 and above 3 for the
     switches within options 4, 6, 8, and 10. I will also check floats.
     Program should and does tell the user to try again with numbers
     within the proper range. In the main switch, it lets the user try
     again, but in the mini switches, it exits the entire program.

Note to the grader: I know that my functions work correctly because they
match the results that the owner of the dataset provided. I included them
in a file called iris-names.txt, if you scroll to the bottom you'll see a
table and you can compare my results if you want. The table is only with
the results from the entire dataset, so they only match my "all" table. I
argue that all of my testing was successful since everything worked as expected.

1

This dataset contains 150 measurements of irises. There 
are three types of iris plants in the dataset: setosa, 
versicolor, and virginica. There are 50 measurements of each 
iris type. Each iris has information of sepal length(cm), 
sepal width(cm), petal length(cm), petal width(cm), and class.

The statistics that will be collected are minimum, maximum, 
mean, and standard deviation.

This dataset contains 150 measurements of irises. There 
are three types of iris plants in the dataset: setosa, 
versicolor, and virginica. There are 50 measurements of each 
iris type. Each iris has information of sepal length(cm), 
sepal width(cm), petal length(cm), petal width(cm), and class.

The statistics that will be collected are minimum, maximum, 
mean, and standard deviation.
