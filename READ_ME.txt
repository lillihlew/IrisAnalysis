Hi graders! This is a breakdown of what each file is and how to run my code.

To run my code, type what's below:
./iris iris-data.txt iris-results.txt

Here's what each file contains:
iris.c is my file with the main function
iris-data.txt contains the data necessary to run the program
iris-header.c is my header with the functions
iris-header.h is my header with the functon prototypes
iris-names.txt contains information about the dataset. I copied it directly
from the website where I got the data. You can check my results for the
"all" options against the table at the bottom of the file.

iris-results.txt is the file that any testing you do will be printed
to. Make sure to look at it before running it again, because every time you
run it it will write over whatever exists in the file.

iris-test.txt is my test plan and transcript
Makefile is the makefile, obviously
READ_ME.txt is this file
results-of-test.txt is the results of my test plan. I moved them to this
file so you could use iris-results.txt for your testing.

Thank you! :)
